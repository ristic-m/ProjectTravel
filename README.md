## Project Travel

This is a mock-up travel agency website. It meets the requirements of consisting of create, read, update, and delete methods in it. 

A user must register to a website. The default role upon registering a new user is the "guest" role, with an ID of 2. If a user wants to have admin permissions, the role ID must be changed to 1.

Admin credentials: 

Email: admin@admin.com
Password: admin12345

The website has 3 destinations from each of the 4 available continents: Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America.

The Dashboard displays all the destinations no matter the continent. A user can view a specific package by clicking a specific date of which they want to see.

In the navigation, there are 4 continents, and upon clicking on one, it will only display destinations from that specific continent. The user can also access packages from here the same as from the dashboard. 

When viewing a package, the page will display the package name, package description, start date, end date, and price. 
For Admin, there will be 2 additional buttons: Update and Delete

The update button will lead the user with admin permissions to the update package page, which will consist of a form that needs to be filled out in order to successfully update the package. 

The Delete button will simply delete the package from the database.

To create a package, simply click on the admin hamburger dropdown link, and there will be an option to create a package. The process is the same as when updating one. 

Contact page is a simple form which sends out the mail to the receiver.
